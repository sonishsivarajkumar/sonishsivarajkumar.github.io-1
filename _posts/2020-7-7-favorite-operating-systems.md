## Which operating systems have I used extensively before?

Linux distributions (and other Unix-like operating systems) such as Manjaro and Elementary OS have been some of the most reliable and best supported operating systems I have used to-date. If you haven't heard of either of them before, feel free to give them a try which you can find instructions to do [here for Manjaro](https://manjaro.org) and [here for Elementary OS](https://elementary.io).
